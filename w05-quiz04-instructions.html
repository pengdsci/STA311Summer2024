This quiz is based on a SAS dataset Sashelp.cars available in SAS permanent library SASHELP. If you can access SAS built-in library Sashelp, 
you can simply read that data directly from the library. For example,    
<BR><BR>
       <center><font color = "blue"> 
                         <b>PROC MEANS DATA </b> = Sashelp.cars;
       </font></center>
<BR>

Otherwise, please download the SAS data file from the course web page and save it to a folder with an appropriate file name.  
The direct link to this datafile: <BR>
<BR>
<center>
<a href="https://stat311.s3.amazonaws.com/w05_quiz4_dataset_cars.sas7bdat">https://stat311.s3.amazonaws.com/w05_quiz4_dataset_cars.sas7bdat</a>
</center>

For example, I download the data file and save it in my folder C:\STA311 and rename the SAS data file as cars. Assuming that Citix SAS can 
access the folder C:\STA311. To use this data file in DATA/ PROC steps, I defined a permanent SAS library pointing to folder C:\STA311: <br>
<BR>
<center><font color = "blue">
                                                      <b>LIBNAME</b> my311 &rdquo;C:\STA311&rdquo;; <br>
                                                      <b>PROC MEANS DATA</b> = my311.cars;
</font> </center>
<BR>                       
More than half of the multiple-choice questions in this quiz require you to write some SAS procedure steps and generate output 
from which you can find the correct answer. The primary procedures you may consider are PROC MEANS, PROC FREQ, and PROC UNIVARIATE.  
Please read the block comments in my example SAS code for the list of available descriptive statistics you can request from each of 
the three procedures and their corresponding definitions. 
<BR><BR>

Some of the questions will ask you to find some of the descriptive statistics such as mean (MEAN), standard deviation (STD), 
lower quartile (Q1), upper quartile (Q3), median (MEDIAN), minimum (MIN), and maximum (MAX) data values, etc. Some of the keywords 
and statements you need to know are TABLE, VAR, BY, and CLASS. You are expected to know which statistics are available in which procedures.
<BR><BR>

Throughout this quiz, I assume that the SAS data set cars is save in C:\STA311. The Citrix SAS can access this folder.
<BR><BR>

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you!
