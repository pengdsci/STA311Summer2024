Hello All,
<BR><BR>

In this note, I outline the topics we are going to cover this week the information about the 
midterm exam #1 to be held on Thursday, 10/01/2020.
<BR><BR>

<B>This Week Topics</B><BR>
We learned three PROcedures: MEANS, FREQ, and UNIVARIATE. These three procedures cover all 
statistics methods introduced in WCU&apos;s MAT121/125 and AP Statistics. As a by-product,  
PROC UNIVARIATE can generate a histogram for a numerical variable.  This week, we are going 
to learn PROC SGPLOT and use to generate all graphics we learned in intro stats courses: 
histogram, bar chart, density curve, scatter plot, least-square regression line. As usual, 
my SAS example code provides a lot of examples with detailed comments on how to set up the 
procedure syntax as well as detailed explanations of related option statements. 
<BR><BR>

The SAS help document for SGPLOT and relevant SG plots can be found from the following link:

 <font color = "red"><b> SAS PROC SGPLOT Help Document</b></font></a></center>
<BR>
Please note that this week&apos;s topics will NOT be covered in the midterm exam.
<BR><BR>

<b>Midterm Exam #1</b><BR>
The following is detailed information about midterm exam #1. This is a programming class, 
I will not ask you to sit in front of the computer for three hours to do coding and answer 
the questions. Instead of giving you three and a half days to complete the weekly quizzes, 
you have 24 hours to complete the midterm exam. You can consider this is a quiz with a 
shorter time window to complete.
<BR><BR>

<font color="red"><i>Timeline:</i></font> Thursday 10/01/2020, 12:00 PM &ndash; Friday 10/02/2020, 12:00 PM.
<BR><BR>

<font color="red"><i>Suggested Time:</i></font>  120 Minutes. This is only a suggested time and will not be enforced.
<BR><BR>

<font color="red"><i>Format:</i></font> About 15 Multiple-choice questions to be completed on D2L. About half of the 
questions require writing SAS code to generate output from which you can find the correct answer.
<BR><BR>

<!--font color="red"><i>Partial Credit Opportunity:</i></font> Please submit your SAS code used for 
answering the exam questions. Make sure your code should be well documented. To be more specific,
your submitted code should have (1) a program header; (2) block comments that include the 
original exam questions; (3) your code, and the output generated from the code. 
<BR><BR-->

I will give you a template of the sample code that you are expected to submit to me. 
<BR><BR>

<font color="red"><i>Make-up Exam:</i></font> There will be no make-up exam. 
I will make the answer to the exam after the due time. Please mark your calendar 
and make sure to submit your exam before the due time.
<BR><BR>

If you must miss the exam due to some unusual circumstances, please let me know before 12:00 PM, 
Thursday, 10/01/2020. I will make an arrangement or figure out a way to quantify your performance 
in the first 5 weeks in this semester.

<BR><BR>
<font color="red"><i>Data Files:</i></font> I will post data files to be used in the exam on the course web page. 
You can download these file to you your machine and save it to a folder, say C:\my311, that Citrix can access. 
<BR>
<ul>
   <li> <a href="forestfires.csv"> forestfire.csv</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This file can be opened in Excel  </li>
   <li> <a href="fish.sas7bdat"> fish (sas data)</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;You are not able to open this SAS data file if 
             your machine does not have SAS software. You simply download it and save it to the designate folder. </li>
   <li> <a href="autoinfo.txt"> autoinfo.txt</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is atab delimtered data, values between variables are 
             separated by one or more blanks. </li>
   <li> <a href="background.xlsx"> background.xlsx</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a typical excel workbook (file extension .xlsx)</li>
</ul>
Once you save all four different data files, write a well-documented SAS program that contains a program header, data steps, 
and possible procedure steps for checking the correctness of the created SAS format data sets based on the four data files. 
Please store all four SAS data files in the temporary library so you can use them to answer some of the questions 
in the midterm exam #1.


<BR><BR>

Please let me know if you have further questions/confusions/concerns.
<BR><BR><BR>

Thank you,
<BR>
Cheng
