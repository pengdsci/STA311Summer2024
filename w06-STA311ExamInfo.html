This is an open book and open note exam. You can use all materials posted on the course 
web page, the online SAS help documents, and other free online postings. However, you should 
not get any form of help from anyone who knows SAS programming. You are also not allowed to 
help your classmates with this midterm exam in any form. An honor pledge statement will be 
placed in the program header of the template SAS program. Please read and type your name 
and WCU email before you submit your SAS code. 
<BR><BR>

<font color="red"><i><b>Coverage:</b></i></font> I assume that you have clear understanding 
of the materials we covered in the first five weeks in this midterm exam. The topics for 
this week will <b>not</b> be covered in this midterm but will be covered in midterm #2.
<BR><BR>

<font color="red"><i><b>Timeline:</b></i></font> Thursday 03/04/2021, 12:00 PM &ndash; 
Friday 03/05/2021, 12:00 PM.<br>
Since this is a programming class, I will not ask you to sit in front of the computer for 
three hours to do coding and answer the questions. In this midterm exam, you have up to 24 
hours to complete midterm exam #1.

<BR><BR>
<font color="red"><i><b>Suggested Time:</b></i></font> 120 Minutes. <font color = "blue">
This is only a suggested time and will not be enforced </font>.

<BR><BR>
<font color="red"><i><b>Format:</b></i></font> The exam contains only multiple-choice questions. 
Most of the questions require writing SAS code and using the following data sets to find the correct 
answer. Unlike the weekly quizzes in which you only multiple-choice questions without 
submitting code, in this exam, you are required to prepare a clean and well-commented SAS code 
that was used in answering the multiple-choice questions and submit it via D2L dropbox. <br><br>

2. To submit your code:  Assessments ==> Assignments

<BR><BR>
<font color="red"><i><b>Data Files:</b></i></font> Create a new exam folder, 
say <font size = 2 color= "darkred" face = "Verdana">C:\sta311-exam01 </font>, and then download 
the following four (4) files and save them to this folder. To access the SAS data set <b>fish</b> 
in the exam folder, you need to define a permanent library pointing to this folder. 
<BR>
<ul>
   <li> <a href="w06-forestfires.csv"> forestfire.csv</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This a CSV format, we 
             introduced different ways to load this format of data files to SAS in previous weeks.  </li>
   <li> <a href="w06-fish.sas7bdat"> fish (sas data)</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;You are not able to open this SAS data file if 
             your machine does not have SAS software. You simply download and save it to the exam folder. </li>
   <li> <a href="w06-autoinfo.txt"> autoinfo.txt</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tab&ndash;delimited data, 
             values between variables are separated by one or more blanks. The bottom portion of the 
             data file is a description of data and variables. Please use 
             appropriate statements and options to read only the data portion to SAS.</li>
   <li> <a href="w06-background.xlsx"> background.xlsx</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; This is a typical 
             excel workbook (file extension .xlsx). We also introduced several different methods 
             to read Excel data to SAS.</li>
</ul>


<font color="red"><i><b>Code Submission Template: </B></i></font>
As a part integral of midterm exam #1, you are required to submit your SAS code via D2L dropbox. 
I created a submission template in both .sas and .txt format. You can download them and save both 
files to the exam folder. You can open the .sas format file from the Citrix SAS
directly. You can also copy and paste the .txt file to the Citrix SAS. 

<BR><center><font size = 2 color= "darkred" face = "Verdana">
 <a href="w06-SubmissionTemplate.sas"> [SAS format]</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<a href="w06-SubmissionTemplate.txt">[Text format]  </a><BR>
 </font></center> 
Please use this template to write SAS code and generate outputs to find the correct answer and 
make sure the submitted code is well-documented.
<BR><BR>

<font color="red"><i><b>Use of Submitted Code:</b></i></font>
As stated in the syllabus, 10% percent of the course grade will be based on the course 
project that involves data management. I will NOT ask you to do a standalone project. 
Instead, I embed the project components into midterm exams and the final exam.
<BR><BR>




This code component will be part of the term project. Please follow the instructions to 
prepare a well-documented code and submit it before the deadline.  You will be asked to 
submit a similar code in the second midterm exam and the final exam. I will grade all 
three code submissions at the end of the semester to assign a grade for the project.
<BR><BR>


<font color="red"><i><b>Make-up Exam:</b></i></font> There will be no make-up exam. 
I will post the answer to the exam on the course web page after the deadline. 
Please mark your calendar and make sure to submit your exam before the deadlines.
<BR><BR>


If you must miss the exam due to some unusual circumstances, please let me know before 12:00 PM, 
Thursday, 03/04/2021. I will make an arrangement or figure out a way to quantify your performance 
in the first 5 weeks of this semester.



Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thank you!
