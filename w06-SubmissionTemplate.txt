                            INSTRUCTIONS

1. This is an open note programming exam. You can use the sample code that I provided 
   in the class. You can also use the internet to get help. However, you are 
   supposed to complete the exam independently. You are not allowed to get 
   help from your classmates or anyone who knows SAS programming.

2. We have learned different SAS statements and procedures to create SAS data 
   sets and perform descriptive statistics. You are expected to use your own 
   naming conventions and different options such as titles, and output controls 
   in your code so your SAS code will be different from your classmates'.

3. After you finish all exam problems on D2L, please follow the next step to 
   prepare your SAS code submission.

4. Edit your SAS code to include
   (a). program header. 
   (b). comments.
   (c). descriptions of each code block (see the description of problem 1, for 
        other problems, copy and paste the original problem - not the multiple 
        choices.) 

5. Submit the SAS code to D2L dropbox BEFORE 13:30 PM , Friday, 03/05/2021.

   go to D2L ==> assessments ==> assignments, you will see "Midterm #1 Code Submission"


   Thank you and good luck!
